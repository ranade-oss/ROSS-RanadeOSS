# ROSS public website

This directory contains the separate public website for ROSS. It is deliberately
isolated from the authenticated application in `../frontend` and the API in
`../backend`.

## Current mode

The site is a governed public-content build for an authenticated public beta
using synthetic or non-confidential materials only. The separate public site
does not authenticate visitors, load application or client data, collect form
submissions, or run product analytics.

An engineering checkpoint is deployed through Sites. The production operator,
final domains, hosting/vendor disclosures, effective legal notices, contact
channels, and independent reviews remain explicit launch blockers.

## Commands

From this directory:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm test
```

`npm test` builds and validates the deployable artifact before testing the
landing page, required public routes, and custom not-found response.

## Structure

- `app/page.tsx` — original ROSS landing page
- `app/[...slug]/page.tsx` — governed public pages, generated coverage, demo,
  workflows, and updates
- `app/page-content.ts` — version-controlled copy and review metadata
- `app/generated-public-coverage.ts` — generated sanitized provider coverage
- `app/site-config.ts` — typed public-site configuration
- `app/site-shell.tsx` — shared header and footer
- `app/globals.css` — responsive design and accessibility foundations
- `tests/*.test.mjs` — built-artifact route, content, link, semantic
  accessibility, and performance-budget tests
- `.openai/hosting.json` — isolated public-site hosting identity

## Boundaries

- Do not copy Mike’s marketing site, copy, screenshots, media logos, demos, or
  distinctive visual assets.
- Do not connect this public site to Supabase, client documents, prompts, or
  application telemetry.
- Keep every source, privacy, security, residency, and readiness claim aligned
  with the approved architecture decisions and current coverage registry.
- Keep previews and search indexing disabled until production domains and
  content approval are complete.
