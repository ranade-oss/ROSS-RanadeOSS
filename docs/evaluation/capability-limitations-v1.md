# ROSS Ontario capability and limitations report — draft v1

**Status:** Controlled-beta limitations reviewed; Ontario legal, privacy, security, accessibility, and product approvals recorded 2026-07-18. Final operational and launch evidence remains pending.

## What this build can demonstrate

ROSS preserves the inherited Mike document, project, workflow, tabular-review, connector, and optional U.S. CourtListener surfaces while adding an Ontario-first, provider-neutral research foundation. It can exercise synthetic A2AJ decision retrieval, official Ontario and federal legislation metadata, Canadian citation parsing, Ontario procedure-source metadata, and five draft Ontario workflows.

The automated seed report scores 11 synthetic cases covering straightforward retrieval, historical law, conflicting authorities, unavailable treatment, mixed federal/provincial issues, regional practice directions, ambiguous jurisdiction, nonexistent citations, quotation verification, procedural deadlines, and document prompt injection.

## What the passing score does not mean

The seed questions and expected results were created for software verification and have not been approved by an Ontario lawyer. The score does not show real-world source recall, legal accuracy, good-law status, bilingual quality, comprehensive court or tribunal coverage, limitation-period reliability, filing readiness, confidentiality suitability, or professional-compliance approval.

## Declared source and product limits

- A2AJ coverage and full-text authority depend on its published service and metadata; the software displays gaps rather than claiming completeness.
- Official legislation integrations preserve currency and reproduction metadata, but historical-version retrieval is not yet comprehensive.
- CanLII access is disabled unless a licensed, entitlement-checked transport is separately approved; ROSS does not scrape it.
- CourtListener remains available only as an optional U.S. provider and is not an Ontario authority source.
- Comprehensive judicial treatment data is unavailable, so ROSS must not claim that a decision is good law from silence.
- Ontario forms, regional directions, deadlines, and workflow outputs require current official-source checks and human review.
- The hosted beta accepts only synthetic or non-confidential material. Real confidential or privileged client files are outside the approved boundary.

## Release state

Automated engineering gates can pass while production remains blocked. Independent legal-content, privacy, security, accessibility, and product-owner approvals are all required, with dated evidence, before this draft can be described as production-ready.

The recommended first validation scope is Ontario civil litigation/appeals and Ontario Small Claims Court because those areas correspond to the five versioned workflow drafts. Criminal, family, tribunal, real-estate, and any unbenchmarked practice area remain explicitly unsupported. `config/professional-validation.v1.json` is the machine-checked source of truth for the provider decision, benchmark review, workflow reviews, and confidential-data boundary.
