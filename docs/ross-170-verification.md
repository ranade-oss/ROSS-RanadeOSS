# ROSS-170 verification

## Implemented

- Versioned legal-source freshness, quarantine, and recovery policy.
- Sanitized pre-production source-health record that cannot be mistaken for a
  live check.
- Deterministic source operations tests for freshness, required/optional
  providers, quarantine, and recovery.
- SHA-256 manifest for governed release artifacts with a freshness check.
- Evidence-bearing operational release gate covering CI, staging, migrations,
  backup/restore, rollback, observability, sources, dependencies, and incidents.
- The ROSS release train produces 90-day evidence while keeping promotion behind its explicit human-approved input.
- Executable release, evidence, backup/restore, rollback, source, observability,
  and security reporting runbooks.

## Boundary

No live infrastructure, backup, restore, penetration test, source observation,
incident drill, vendor, domain, or operator has been selected or exercised by
these files. Their records remain pending and production intentionally fails
closed.
