# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve ROSS, a modified fork of Mike. Please keep
contributions small, focused, and easy to review while preserving the inherited
Mike functionality recorded in the baseline contract.

## Guidelines

- Prefer targeted edits over broad refactors.
- Keep each PR focused on one bug, feature, or cleanup.
- Update docs or env examples when changing setup, config, or user-facing behavior.
- Please do not propose local-hosting refactors for the main app, such as local LLMs, local databases, or local filesystem storage. Those ideas are better suited to a future fully local version of the project.
- Do not commit secrets, API keys, private documents, or local `.env` files.
- Do not use confidential, privileged, regulated, proprietary, or real client
  material in fixtures, previews, demonstrations, issues, or pull requests.
- Do not scrape CanLII. Licensed connectors require an approved agreement,
  transport, entitlement, and activation record.

## Before Opening a PR

- Install all dependencies from the repository root with `npm run install:all`.
- Run the baseline contract tests with `npm test`.
- Run the full local verification suite with `npm run check`.
- For a release-candidate change, regenerate and verify the governed manifest
  with `npm run build:release-manifest` and `npm run test:release-manifest`.
- If deployed test URLs are available, run `ROSS_E2E_API_URL=... ROSS_E2E_APP_URL=... npm run test:e2e`.
- Check `git diff` and remove unrelated changes.
- Write a concise Markdown PR description with:
    - summary
    - changes
    - why
    - testing
    - tradeoffs and risk
    - upstream provenance, when applicable

## Testing Expectations

- Add a regression test at the lowest practical layer for each feature or bug
  fix. Prefer a focused unit test, then a route or integration test, and use an
  end-to-end test only when a browser or deployed service is necessary to prove
  the behaviour.
- Do not weaken, skip, broadly disable, or delete an existing test merely to
  make a change pass. Correct stale expectations only when the implementation
  and governing contract demonstrate that the expectation is obsolete.
- Record the exact commands run in the PR description. Baseline verification is
  required on the final PR head; a successful run on an earlier commit is not
  sufficient.
- Tests requiring live Supabase, provider keys, or deployed URLs must be
  explicitly environment-gated and must not expose secrets or real client data.
- Changes to authentication, authorization, privacy, data boundaries,
  migrations, deployment, or release mechanics require focused verification in
  addition to the normal Baseline.

## System Workflows

System workflows live in `mike-workflows/system/`. Put structured metadata in
the YAML frontmatter at the top of `SKILL.md`, put workflow instructions in the
body of `SKILL.md`, and use `table-config.yaml` for tabular review columns.

After changing system workflows, regenerate the app files:

```bash
node scripts/build-workflows.js
```

## Security

Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Use
[ROSS private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/ranade-oss/ROSS-RanadeOSS/security/advisories/new)
instead. If an issue also affects upstream Mike, coordinate disclosure before
opening an upstream report or pull request.

We will aim to respond promptly and coordinate a disclosure timeline with you.

## Local Development

Backend:

```bash
npm run build --prefix backend
```

Frontend:
